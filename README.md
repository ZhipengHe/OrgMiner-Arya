* PM4Py (for the discovery of process models as Petri Nets, Directly-Follows Graphs, etc)
* PyGraphviz (for handling the manipulation of graphical objects and converstion to DOTSTRING for rendering)
* d3-graphviz (for the visualization using a web-page and SVG based solution)
* Flask (for building a simple web app to cover the interactive process for visualization, optional)
