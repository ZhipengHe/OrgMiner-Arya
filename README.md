# Hinata
A project for blended visualization of process models and organizational models based on the viewpoint of execution modes.

Hinata is expected to be built on the following projects:

* OrgMiner (for the discovery of execution modes and organizational models from an given event log)
* PM4Py (for the discovery of process models as Petri Nets, Directly-Follows Graphs, etc)
* d3-graphviz (for the visualization using a web-page and SVG based solution)
* Flask (for building a simple web app to cover the interactive process for visualization, optional)
